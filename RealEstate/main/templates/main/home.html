{% block paragraph %} A personal essay on the dream house I will someday live in. My ideal future home would be a spacious, well- designed house with plenty of outdoor space. The layout of the house should be designed to allow for plenty of privacy and flexibility. I would also like a home that is energy-efficient and environmentally friendly. In terms of furniture, I would prefer something that is both comfortable and stylish. {% endblock %}
